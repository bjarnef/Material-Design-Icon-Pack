Thanks to Warren Buckley for creating the Belle Icon Pack: http://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/belle-icon-pack

Known issue
There seems to be issues with Firefox to display the added font-icons (not the core icons). In Chrome and Internet Explorer it isn't a problem, so maybe Firefox has an issue with loading the css file and/or the font-files.
